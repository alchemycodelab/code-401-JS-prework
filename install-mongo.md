![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Install MongoDB

## Installation and Setup
- [Installation Instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Create a folder called `db` in  your `codefellows/401` folder
- Startup your mongo server with this command: `mongod --dbpath=/PATH/TO/codefellows/db` (substituting your actual path to that folder)
- You should see output that looks like this, indicating that your mongodb server is up and running:

```
2018-09-25T17:34:13.054-0700 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] MongoDB starting : pid=75078 port=27017 dbpath=/Users/john/codefellows/tools/db 64-bit host=cfc.localdomain
...
2018-09-25T17:34:14.191-0700 I NETWORK  [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017
```


- Once your server is running, open a new terminal window or tab and open the mongo client by typing `mongo`
- Your output should look like what appears below. Specifically, we're looking for the `>` on the last line, indicating that you can type in database commands.
- You can type `exit` to leave the shell
- Stop the server in the other terminal by pressing `CTRL+C`

```
