### Get this code up and running Travis and Heroku!

In the `starter-code` folder, you will find the base code that you should be configuring and deploying.

The `solution` folder is provided as a reference (it's the code produced in the tutorial video) so that you can compare your deployed code and README to the accepted standard. 


## Requirements

- Connect Travis to your git account
  - Check that travis finds this newly created repo

- Connect Heroku to your git account
  - Set heroku to auto deploy your repository from master (or any named branch)
  
- Create documentation

- Compose a complete "README"

## Testing
* unit and lint tests in starter code pass in travis

### Assignment Submission Instructions
* Submit a link to the Repository you created for this lab, which should have a completed README.md file
