## Editor Configuration
- Set your computer up with your editor of choice. Your developer environment is your own, please set it up and customize it to your liking.
  - VS Code, Webstorm, Atom, Cloud 9, vim, ...
- Create a working folder called `codefellows` created on your computer where all of your coursework will reside
- In this folder, create a subdirectory called `401` for this class
- Upload the  .eslintrc.json file into your `codefellows/401` folder (found in the "configs" folder of this repository) so that your files will conform to our standards.
- Install the .editorconfig file to work with your chosen editor (most editors support this)
