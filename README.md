# Code Fellows PDX Code 401JS

## Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

### Pre-work

This is the pre-work for Code 401. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it prior to the start of class.

##### 1. Setup your computer with Terminal, Git, GitHub, VSCode, and Ryver

From Code 301, you should already have Terminal and Git installed, as well as a Github account. (If you are testing in and have any questions about this, please contact us).

For Code 401, we will be using the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as our IDE code editor. It has an integrated debugger that works out-of-the-box with node.js, and we have found it to be generally more stable and more performant than Atom.

For messaging and communication, we will be using Ryver. You will receive an invite and while Ryver has a web browser app, we recommend [downloading](https://ryver.com/downloads/) and installing the desktop app. They also have mobile apps available.


### Optional Pre-work
If you have time and want to review some Javscript fundamentals there are two main resources you should look at.  A few chapters from the You Don't Know JS series are sectioned off as reading assignments but it's fine if you want to get a head start:
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [You Don't Know JS series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) (specifically, the "Scopes and Closures" and "this & Object Prototypes" books)

If you are testing into 401 or need additional practice on GIT, check out the following Udemy course.  This should help get you up to speed:
