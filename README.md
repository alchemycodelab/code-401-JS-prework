Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

### Pre-work

This is the pre-work for Code 401. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it prior to the start of class.

##### 1. Setup your computer with Terminal, Git, GitHub, VSCode, and Ryver

From Code 301, you should already have Terminal and Git installed, as well as a Github account. (If you are testing in and have any questions about this, please contact us).

For Code 401, we will be using the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as our IDE code editor. It has an integrated debugger that works out-of-the-box with node.js, and we have found it to be generally more stable and more performant than Atom.

**Note: All prework is due before start of first class**
